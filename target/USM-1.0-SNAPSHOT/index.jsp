 User management describes the ability for administrators to manage user access to various IT resources like systems, devices, applications, storage systems, networks, SaaS services, and more. User management is a core part to any directory service and is a basic security essential for any organization. User management enables admins to control user access and on-board and off-board users to and from IT resources. Subsequently a directory service will then authenticate, authorize, and audit user access to IT resources based on what the IT admin had dictated.

Traditionally, user management has been grounded with on-prem servers, databases, and closed virtual private networks (VPN). However, recent trends are seeing a shift towards cloud-based identity and access management (IAM), granting administrators even greater control over digital assets.

 Simply put user management solves the problem of managing user access to various resources. For example, the marketing team generally requires access to different resources than the accounting team. Further, an employee on the marketing likely doesn?t need access to internal financial systems and vice versa, a finance employee isn?t requiring access to Salesforce or Marketo. User management enables IT administrators to manage resources and provision users based on need and role.

Recent innovations in cloud technology have sparked a revolution in cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform among others. Coupled with web applications, users have more IT resources available at their fingertips than ever before, which is why user management has never been more essential.
